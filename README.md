1. I did a classic 3-layers app without ORM. 
2. I could add more patterns and technologies to my code, but I am having a lot of work and interviews now. We can talk during the technical interview about my expirience
and technologies which I know in more details 
3. I worked in most of all cases only with back side, so I implements front on jsp. But I do not mind to learn Angular or React if you need a full-stack.
